# Work-Day-Planner

## Description

* I wanted to create a work day planner with persistent data to help plan out your work day from 9am-5pm

* You will see a dynamic header on the page to display the current date you are accessing the site

* It was a challenge to incorporate third-party APIs such as bootstrap, JQuery and Moment.js and utilize local storage

* This exercise really helped me visualize the power of these APIs

* In the future I'd like to implement some more basic features in the planner such as color-coded cells
